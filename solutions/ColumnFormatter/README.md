# Column Formatter

Easy editor for modern listview Column Formatting

![Column Formatter In Action](./assets/ColumnFormattingChristmas.gif)

## Summary

Modern listviews support the addition of [custom formatting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/column-formatting) for most field types. This is an awesome feature designed to make custom formatting simpler and less administratively difficult than packaged solutions. Unfortunately, the tooling is still very minimal.

**Column Formatter has been designed to give the full power of VS Code editing while providing easy to use templates and wizards all within the browser!** The goal is to make writing and applying Column Formatting easier and quicker for both developers and end users.

Column Formatter is a client-side webpart for use within Office 365.
